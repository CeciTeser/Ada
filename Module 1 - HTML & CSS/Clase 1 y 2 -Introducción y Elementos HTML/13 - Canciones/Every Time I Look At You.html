    <div>
        <p>Tryin' to say I'm sorry
            <br>
            Didn't mean to break your heart
            <br>
            And find you waitin' up by the light of day
            <br>
            There's a lot I wanna to tell you
            <br>
            But I don't know where to start
            <br>
            And I don't know what I'd do if you walked away</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <p>Ooh, baby, I tried to make it
            <br>
            I just got lost along the way</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <p>But every time I look at you
            <br>
            No matter what I'm goin' through
            <br>
            It's easy to see
            <br>
            And every time I hold you
            <br>
            The things I never told you
            <br>
            Seem to come easily
            <br>
            'Cause you're everything to me</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <p>I never really wanted to let you get inside my heart
            <br>
            I wanted to believe this would soon be ending
            <br>
            I thought it wouldn't matter, if it all just came apart
            <br>
            But now I realize I was just pretending</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <p>Ooh, baby, I know I hurt you
            <br>
            But you can still believe in me</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <p>'Cause every time I look at you
            <br>
            No matter what I'm goin' through
            <br>
            It's easy to see
            <br>
            And every time I hold you
            <br>
            The things I never told you
            <br>
            Seem to come easily
            <br>
            'Cause you're everything to me</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <p>It's gonna take a little time to show you
            <br>
            Just what you mean to me, oh yeah
            <br>
            It seems the more I get to know you
            <br>
            The more I need to make you see
            <br>
            You're everything I need, yeah
            </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <p>Oho, I need ya, I need ya, I need ya, yeah, yeah
            <br>
            Ooh, baby, baby, baby, I know I hurt you
            <br>
            But you can still believe in me</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <p>'Cause every time I look at you
            <br>
            No matter what I'm goin' through
            <br>
            It's easy to see
            <br>
            And every time I hold you
